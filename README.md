# Deep Learning Projects
These are deep learning projects I have built in my BYU Computer Science 474 course. These projects are all built using Python and PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework.

The projects replicate state-of-the-art deep learning techniques published in various academic papers, ranging from image style transfer, convolutional nerual networks, sequence to sequence text prediction, and transformer language translation.

Boilerplate code was provided by my professor for data loading and various library installations. All other code was written by myself.
